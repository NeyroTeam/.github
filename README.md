## Our Approach

At NeyroTeam, we're committed to exploring the practical applications of AI in software development. Our goal is to create tools that are both powerful and user-friendly, making AI technology more accessible to Discord communities and developers alike.

## What We Do

- **AI-Enhanced Discord Bot**: We develop bot that bring useful AI features to Discord servers.
- **API Development**: We're working on creating API that allow easier integration of AI capabilities into various projects.
- **Developer Tools**: We create libraries and tools to help developers work with our AI solutions more easily.

## Our Projects

1. **NeyroGen**: Our main Discord bot, incorporating AI features to enhance server functionality and user experience.
2. **NeyroAPI**: An API powering NeyroGen, which will soon be available for public use, allowing developers to integrate similar AI capabilities into their own projects.
3. **NeyroAPI-Library**: A library available in Python and JavaScript, designed to simplify interaction with NeyroAPI for developers.
